- Good engineering is less about finding the "perfect" solution and more about understanding the tradeoffs and being able to explain them.
- Performance issues: 
  1) IO operations.
  2) Memory allocations and the garbage collector.
  3) Efficient access to data.
  4) Algorithm efficiency.
- Read code FIRST, then optimize for correctness and performance.
- Your software should work 24/7 without issues, and it is desirable to be efficient and output reliable code.
