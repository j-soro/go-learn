- Integrity (reliability) is nยบ 1: life is embedded in technology in our society
  - Micro level: every loc allocates, reads or writes memory. The type system is critical to having integrity.
  - Macro level: data transformation must be accurate, consistent and efficient. Writing less code and error handling.
  - Write less code: less is always more. 1000 loc = 15-50 bugs.
  - Error handling: engineering is about when life is bad and in crisis.
  - Less code and error handling are essential if we want integrity.
- Readability:
  - Development is all about collaboration. We must balance skill levels for the good of a project.
  - Codebase must be clean and healthy with the mental models clear and fast to understand.
  - Go helps with readability by not having too many features that hide cost (they don't help us).
  - Making things easy to do is a false economy. Focus on making things easy to understand. (Peter Bourgon).
- Simplicity: *Hiding cost vs hiding complexity*
  - Simplifying things can cause more problems than good.
  - Simplicity is about hiding complexity via encapsulation.
  - Go is an amazing language when it comes to simplicity engineering.
  - Simplicity is Complicated - Rob Pike
  - What did Alan Kay mean List is the greatest programming language - Alan Kay
  - Make sure encapsulations are providing a new semantic, precise level of understanding that is not hiding cost, but hiding complexity.
